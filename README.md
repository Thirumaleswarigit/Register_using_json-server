# User Registration System using Python & JSON Server

## Project Description
This project is a simple yet powerful **User Registration System** built with **Python** for the frontend logic and **JSON Server** as a mock backend.

It allows users to **register accounts**, **validate credentials**, and **store data in JSON format**, providing a lightweight and efficient way to handle user information without a full-fledged database.

## Key Features
- **User Registration:** Users can sign up with username, password, and email.  
- **Password Confirmation:** Ensures correct password entry before registration.  
- **Data Storage:** User information is stored in a JSON file using JSON Server as a mock API.  
- **Data Retrieval:** Existing user data can be fetched and displayed.  
- **Error Handling:** Prevents duplicate registrations and invalid inputs.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – for backend logic and input handling  
- **JSON Server** – to simulate a REST API for storing user data  
- **Requests Library (Python)** – for API calls (GET, POST)  
- **VS Code** – IDE for development  

## Why This Project?
- Great practice for **working with APIs and JSON data**  
- Introduces the concept of **frontend-backend communication**  
- Helps in understanding **HTTP methods** like GET and POST  
- Lightweight project suitable for beginners to **showcase Python skills**  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a functional **User Registration System** using Python and JSON Server.  
It helped me gain hands-on experience with **API requests, JSON data handling, and input validation**.  
Overall, it’s a practical foundation for **building more advanced web or full-stack applications**.
